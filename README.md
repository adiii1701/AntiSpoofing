# AntiSpoofing
This real-time system uses a YOLOv8 model to detect whether a face is real or fake via webcam. It draws colored bounding boxes with confidence scores and class labels ("REAL" or "FAKE") and displays the FPS. Built with OpenCV, cvzone, and Ultralytics YOLO, itâ€™s fast, efficient, and customizable.
